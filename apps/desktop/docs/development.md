# Development

La marca visible es Danil. La instalación y compatibilidad de `danil` y `dn`
están en [danil-cli.md](danil-cli.md). El empaquetado conserva `Terminus` y
el binario `terminus` para actualizar las instalaciones existentes.

## Daily loop

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev                 # Vite only: the front in a browser, without Tauri or engine
pnpm window:build        # debug window with the front embedded
pnpm engine:start        # engine with throwaway data + window
```

The window embeds `dist/` (feature `extracted-client`, on by default), so after
changing the front run `pnpm window:build` again, then `node scripts/engine.mjs
window` to open another window against the running engine.

`scripts/engine.mjs` commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `download [--from <path>]` | Downloads the engine pinned in `seldon-runtime.lock` and checks its SHA-256, or copies a local binary |
| `sidecar` | Places the pinned engine in `src-tauri/binaries/` for `bundle.externalBin` (on macOS both architectures and their `lipo`); Rust builds need it, and `beforeDevCommand`, `beforeBuildCommand` and `pnpm verify` run it |
| `engine` | Starts the engine with data under `.engine/lab/` and identity `ai.danil.seldon.dev` |
| `select` | Asks the engine for `status` and writes a private `selection.json` |
| `window [--window <path>]` | Opens the window against that selection |
| `start` | `engine`, `select` and `window` |
| `status`, `stop` | Engine status; stop the engine when it has no work |

All commands accept `--lab <dir>` to use another lab folder. The engine's log is
`engine.log` in the lab, the window's stderr is `window.err`.

The lab drops every `SELDON_*`, `TERMINUS_*` and `DANIL_*` variable of the calling
shell, so it never signs in with the machine's real Danil credential. The one
exception is a `DANIL_COMPUTERS_URL` pointing at `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`,
for a local fake control plane.

On a machine with little memory, limit Rust parallelism:
`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 pnpm window:build`.

After `pnpm build`, `node tests/helpers/zcode-provider-ui.mjs` checks external
provider installation, account gating and retry recovery in the compiled front
with simulated IPC. It runs manually, outside `pnpm verify`, and does not check
the native window or a real ZCode account.

## Remote verify

`pnpm verify --remote` runs the Linux chain on the team machine `vm-verify`
and needs access to Danil's tailnet (`ssh verify@vm-verify` must work). Without
it the command says so; use `pnpm verify`. It never counts for macOS or Windows.

Access: `alberto`, `alejandro`, `mauricio`, `roberto`, `cit`, and the machines
`tag:vm-alberto`, `tag:vm-alejandro` and `tag:vm-mauricio`.

The client needs only Node, git, `ssh` on the PATH and Tailscale, so it runs the
same from PowerShell or cmd on Windows (`ssh.exe` is the OpenSSH Client optional
feature). What runs is still Linux: a run launched from Windows verifies Linux.

```sh
pnpm verify --remote                   # HEAD; refuses uncommitted changes
pnpm verify --remote --no-cargo        # the chain without Rust
pnpm verify --remote --commit <sha>    # any local commit
pnpm verify --remote --detach          # queue and return; prints the run id
pnpm verify --remote --attach <id>     # follow a run, replaying the full log
pnpm verify --remote --cancel <id>     # stop a queued or running run
pnpm verify --remote --status          # what is queued and running
```

The exit code is the run's. The run lives on the machine: if the client dies,
it goes on and `--attach` gets its log and exit code. The commit travels as a
`git bundle`, incremental against what the machine already has, because the
machine holds no secrets and clones nothing. Running a commit executes it, so
an outside pull request goes there only after someone reads it.

`VERIFY_REMOTE_HOST=<machine>` reaches the queue through an SSH tunnel;
`VERIFY_REMOTE_HOST=<host>:<port>` uses a port already open, such as an SSM
port forward to 8787. The machine stops itself after 15 idle minutes. A run, a
bundle upload, and sessions and builds younger than 2 hours count as use, so a
forgotten shell stops counting at 2 hours and the machine stops 15 minutes later.

If the queue does not answer and SSH did not refuse, the client starts the
machine and asks again every 15 seconds, up to four minutes, while the queue
stays silent; a machine that is still stopping refuses the first attempts.

1. `danil computers machine start vm-verify --json`, with the caller's Danil
   session (`DANIL_CLI` for the binary).
2. `terminus machine start vm-verify --json`, the same with the installed client
   (`TERMINUS_CLI` for the binary), only when `danil` is missing, does not know
   the command, or refuses the environment because it holds `TERMINUS_*` context.
   `VERIFY_REMOTE_TERMINUS` replaces steps 1 and 2 with one binary, called with
   `machine start vm-verify --json`.
3. `aws ec2 start-instances` with the caller's credentials (`AWS_PROFILE`,
   `VERIFY_REMOTE_AWS` for the binary), only when no CLI knows the command, or
   one answers `machine_account`, `machine_unreachable` or
   `identity_unavailable`. `IncorrectInstanceState` retries; any other failure
   ends the run. Windows builds without these CLIs always land here.

`computer_stopping` retries. `access_denied`, `license_required`, `not_found`
and any other refusal from a CLI end the run with the reason.

The queue is `scripts/verify-queue/server.mjs`: one per machine, one run at a
time, first come first served, listening on loopback only. It takes repo, commit
and a command listed in `repos.json`, and knows nothing else about a repo. Each
repo has one fixed checkout and one fixed `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` under
`/var/lib/verify-queue/repos/`; everything else is cleaned between runs. Above
80 % disk it deletes the target, before a run or after a failed one, and
rebuilds once. The user `verify` runs branch code, so `egress.nft` denies it
IMDS, the tailnet and private networks, and the `tailscaled` socket is closed to
it; it keeps internet access for packages. To install or update it, copy
`scripts/verify-queue/` to the machine and run `install.sh` as root.

## Sweeping `target/`

`node scripts/sweep-targets.mjs --root <worktrees>` lists the `target/` folders
that nothing touched in 24 hours and no `cargo` or `rustc` is using. `--apply`
deletes them.

## The browser build

The same front runs in a browser against Danil Computers instead of the Tauri
window. `src/web/` holds only that entry: it answers the globals of
`@tauri-apps/api` with a transport over the relay session socket, so the desktop
bundle never imports it, and its phrases live in `src/locales/*/web.json`,
which the desktop catalogs leave out. `options.headers` of `invoke` reach the
transport (`x-terminus-workspace` is honored; other headers are ignored for now).

```sh
TERMINUS_WEB_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project>.supabase.co \
TERMINUS_WEB_SUPABASE_KEY=<publishable key> \
pnpm web:build      # dist-web/<base>/ plus dist-web/index.html and dist-web/_headers
pnpm web:dev        # Vite on <base>web.html with the same settings
```

`pnpm web:build` ends with `scripts/web-mobile.mjs`: the phone app
(`apps/mobile`, Expo for web) built into `dist-web/<base>m/` with the same
public settings, so it needs `npm ci` in `apps/mobile` first. A phone (small,
touch screen: `PHONE_QUERY` in `@terminus/design`) that opens `<base>` goes to
`<base>m/`; each version links to the other and the choice is kept in
`localStorage` (`terminus.web.layout`). Both share the origin, the Danil app's
Supabase session and `_headers`. A deep link under `<base>m/` that falls back to
`index.html` is passed to the phone app as `?to=`. `web:dev` serves only the
desktop version.

Build-time settings (environment variables; all are public values):

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `TERMINUS_WEB_BASE` | `/terminus/` | Path the page is served under |
| `TERMINUS_WEB_ENDPOINT` | `https://computers.danil.ai` | Control plane and relay; added to `connect-src` as `https` and `wss` |
| `TERMINUS_WEB_SUPABASE_URL` | none | The Danil app's Supabase project; added to `connect-src` |
| `TERMINUS_WEB_SUPABASE_KEY` | none | Its publishable (anon) key |
| `TERMINUS_WEB_LOGIN` | `<base>auth` | Browser sign-in entry when there is no session; an override must preserve `next` |
| `TERMINUS_WEB_CONNECT` | empty | Extra `connect-src` sources |

The page shares the Danil app's origin and Supabase session storage. Without a
session it opens `<base>auth`, shared with the phone browser and device approval.
This entry supports email/password registration and sign-in, Google and Microsoft,
email confirmation and resending confirmation. Authentication callbacks run here
before the machine gate or phone redirect. `next` stays inside the configured
Danil base and travels in the callback URL, including a device code; it does
not depend on the original tab's storage. Supabase must allow that callback URL
and its email templates must preserve the supplied redirect. Registration does
not grant a license or provision a machine. After a 401
from the API or a relay close 4003 it calls `refreshSession()` and, if that
fails, goes to the login. It lists the person's computers (`GET
/v1/computers`), opens the only one or the remembered one, or shows a picker
that can also start a computer; `?computer=<id>` opens that one. Opening does
not start a computer: an off one mounts as it is, with the machine-off notice.
The page runs the desktop's router over `@terminus/fleet`
(`src/features/machines/router.ts` with no engine of its own): workspaces and
projects come from the account registry, and each machine's tasks, folders and
spaces are its slice, the saved one first (the page's copy or the relay's,
marked saved with its time) and the live one behind. An off machine with a copy
is not asked; one that does not answer keeps its last slice; one of another
contract shows outdated. Only an action waits: the relay's intent commands
(send a message, create a task, answer a permission…) wake a managed VM, and an
action to the person's own machine that is off says so by name. The installer
screen never shows (`localSetup` in `lib/platform.ts`). Before
reconnecting the socket it asks the API again, so a missing license or a
computer that is not theirs shows a notice instead of a blind retry. A page
that sets `window.terminusWeb` before the script loads can override any of the
settings above, or give `{ endpoint, computerId, getToken }` and skip the
session and the picker.

What the window does locally (native sites, Typst live, tray, updater, local
file pickers, opening files on the host) answers with `web.desktop_only` or a
browser equivalent. `tests/unit/web-transport.test.mjs` and
`tests/unit/web-gate.test.mjs`, `tests/unit/web-setup.test.mjs`, `tests/unit/web-off.test.mjs`, `tests/unit/web-cached.test.mjs` and `tests/unit/web-onboarding.test.mjs` mount `dist-web/` against a relay simulated in
Node (`tests/helpers/fake-relay.mjs`).

`dist-web/` is served at the root of alfa-app.danil.ai (`alpha-entry/`, built
with `TERMINUS_WEB_BASE=/`). `dist-web/_headers` carries the policy with
`frame-ancestors 'none'`, and `dist-web/index.html` is the single-page fallback
for paths under the base. `wrangler.web.toml` no longer serves the web: it
deploys `web-redirect/worker.mjs` as the private Worker `terminus-web`, which
the Danil app reaches for `/terminus/*` through a Service Binding and which
answers 308 to the same path on alfa-app.danil.ai without the prefix. It has no
Workers Builds trigger.

## The engine pin

`seldon-runtime.lock` pins the engine release for each platform, keyed by Rust
target triple, as published in the release manifest `seldon-runtime.json`:

```json
"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc": { "url": "https://github.com/danil-labs/terminus/releases/download/seldon-runtime-v…/seldon-runtime-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe", "sha256": "…" }
```

A platform with an empty `url` has no published engine yet; `engine.mjs
download` stops with an error that says so.

`url` may point to a bare executable or to a `.zip`/`.tar.gz` that contains
`seldon-runtime` (or `seldon-runtime.exe`). The SHA-256 is of the downloaded
file. `contract` must match the hash in
[PROVENANCE](../src-tauri/crates/engine-protocol/PROVENANCE.md); the window
refuses an engine that speaks another contract.

The contract comes from seldon-host (`crates/engine-protocol/commands.json`),
copied byte for byte. Copying a newer one is not enough: the window computes
its contract from those bytes, so it refuses the pinned engine until a
`seldon-runtime` release with the same contract is published
([runtime-binary-release.md](https://github.com/danil-labs/seldon-host/blob/dev/docs/runtime-binary-release.md)) and pinned here. Until then
the `contract` guard requires the pending contract to be named in
`MOTOR_PENDIENTE`, and `publish.yml` refuses to publish.

## Bundled work tools

Git, Python with the document libraries, uv, ripgrep, agent-browser and Cua
ship prepared inside the app; nothing is extracted or installed at first
launch. The pins are `resources/work-tools/<target>/pins.json` and
`documents-requirements.txt` (every wheel with its hash). draw.io is a plugin,
not part of this base.

```sh
python3 scripts/work-tools.py prepare --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --download
python3 scripts/work-tools-smoke.py build/work-tools/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
python3 tests/release/work-tools.test.py
```

`prepare` downloads into `build/work-tools/.payloads/`, extracts every archive
into one tree, installs the wheels with the pinned uv (`--target`
`--python-platform`, so the x86_64 macOS tree builds on Apple silicon without
Rosetta), drops the packages' `tests/`, precompiles bytecode with
`--invalidation-mode unchecked-hash`, adds `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` and the
`python` alias, and writes `inventory.json` and `manifest.json`. Building a
macOS tree off macOS needs `--cross` and skips Cua's signature check; it is
never used for packaging. `--tauri-config` writes the overlay `publish.yml`
passes to `tauri build`: Tauri's `resources` copy the target of every symlink,
so macOS and the AppImage use `bundle.macOS.files` and
`bundle.linux.appimage.files`, which keep them. The AppImage carries them in
`usr/share/Terminus/`: linuxdeploy walks `usr/lib` and would copy every
library the tools link into the image. Windows trees have no symlinks
and use `resources`.

`work-tools-smoke.py` runs the tree in place with a `PATH` without node, npm,
pnpm, bun, python or git and without `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`, then checks the
tree still matches its inventory. `work-tools-runtime-smoke.py` does the same
through a packaged engine; it needs an engine that reads schema 2.

WebView2 on Windows comes from `bundle.windows.webviewInstallMode` in
`src-tauri/tauri.windows.conf.json` (`embedBootstrapper`: about 2 MB, still
needs a network on a Windows 10 without WebView2).

## Releases

Maintainers publish with a version tag:

1. Bump the version in `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and
   `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (`pnpm version:bump`), and update
   `release-notes/en.md` and `release-notes/es.md`.
2. Merge to `main`, tag `v<version>` and push the tag.

[`publish.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/publish.yml) builds, signs and publishes.
It refuses to publish while `seldon-runtime.lock` is not pinned for every
platform or the engine is not bundled (`bundle.externalBin`): an installed copy
updated to a window without its engine would not open. To test a change to the
workflow without publishing:

```sh
gh workflow run publish.yml -R danil-labs/terminus --ref <branch> -f dry_run=true
```

A dry run spends no eSigner signatures: Windows builds without
`signCommand` and its installed files are checked for presence, not for
Authenticode. eSigner itself is only exercised by a real release.

`node tests/release/publish.test.mjs` (macOS or Linux, needs Ruby and jq)
runs the packaging steps of the workflow with fixtures and temporary signing
keys.

The identity of the installed app — updater public key, bundle identifier
`ai.danil.terminus` and product name — is duplicated in `publish.yml` on
purpose. Changing any of them strands installed copies; read the comments
there first.

## Line endings

`.gitattributes` checks out every text file with LF on all platforms. Generated
files and the contract hash depend on it.
