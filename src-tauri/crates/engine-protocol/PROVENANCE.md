# Contract provenance

RPC1 and `commands.json` were derived from the Terminus engine source
(`danil-labs/harness-app`, commit `96dba061f0db4af915f6d035c8413fbd0fb430fb`,
Apache-2.0); the manifest was regenerated on
`b40d34999d140d30a0e1192ba752b2fdb860dc90`. The generator reads the engine
source and is not part of this repository.

`commands.json`: 316 commands, 291 ordinary invocations, three channels and
twenty-two window/bridge functions. Names, camelCase parameters, reference Rust
types and literal events are kept. SHA-256:
`2701d8c1cf79951ba997598922d44ad1bec42c85e84808bb1c09b92f57f7f827`.

`phrase-keys.json`: the catalog keys the engine sends as `Frase` values, taken
from the engine source at `fdf4dd9863a80363a0dd7b15ea21fd6b69e1f4bd`.

Endpoint, selection and StreamPage extend the transport; they do not convert
domain data. The token travels in RPC1 only between authenticated local
processes, read from a protected file; it is never handed to the webview.
